## Key Insights

1. Saturdays and Sundays are consistently low-transaction days across most locations, suggesting lower weekend foot traffic.

2. Across all stores, peak transactions are between 8–11am, which reflects strong morning commuter demand (6-10am for Astoria).

3. Transaction volume tends to decline after 12pm, indicating that afternoon/evening is underutilized.

4. Bakery items perform well, showing strong pairing with beverages.

5. Niche categories (chocolate, beans, packaged goods) are minimal contributors.

6. Syrups and packaged products are very low performers.

---

## Business Recommendations

- Since 8–11am is the crunch time, ensure staffing is highest in mornings.
   
- Introduce mobile ordering & quick-pickup lanes to speed service for morning rush.

- Introduce afternoon happy hour specials (discount tea/coffee refills, bakery markdowns) to mitigate Revenue drops post-12pm

- Launch weekend promotions or loyalty offers (e.g., “Buy 1, Get 1” or family bundles) to capture more leisure customers to boost Weekend Sales.

- Introduce bakery meal deals (coffee + pastry) to raise attach rate to boost bakery sales.

- Capitalize on seasonal variations (spiced chai, flavored hot chocolates) to push margins.

- Consider downsizing low-Performers (Packaged chocolate, branded items, and syrups = low revenue) to reallocate shelf space for high-performing categories.

---

## Location-Specific Actions
Astoria: 

- Transactions drop after 10am
- Explore localized marketing or community events
- Offer brunch/happy hour specials

Hell’s Kitchen:

- Stronger Sunday traffic compared to others
- Could test weekend brunch-style offerings
- Close business at 7pm to improve profit margins (low transactions and generated revenue past 7pm)

Lower Manhattan: 

- High growth but depends on Monday Morning commuters
- Consider delivery partnerships to capture remote workers
- Close business at 6pm or 630pm to improve profit margins as transactions and revenue after this time is almost neglibile

---

Summary:

• Morning commuter business is the backbone

• Coffee + Tea dominate, with bakery as a cross-sell opportunity.

• Weekends and Afternoons need targeted offers to lift lagging performance
